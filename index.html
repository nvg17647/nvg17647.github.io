<h2 style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><b><u><font size="5px">About Us</font></b></u></h2>
<p> ServeUGA advances and promotes a culture of service at UGA. ServeUGA advances service by acting as a resource for the University of Georgia and Athens-Clarke County, empowering students to engage directly in the local community through service, education, and advocacy. ServeUGA promotes service by strengthening collaboration among UGA student organizations and connecting the student body with service-related resources and opportunities. ServeUGA is composed of an executive board, general members called Service Ambassadors and approximately 40 student organizations that embrace advocacy, philanthropy, or hands-on service as one of their primary purposes.</p>
<hr />
<h3><u><font size="5px">Get Involved</font></u></h3>
<p> ServeUGA Service Ambassadors lead service experiences and serve as resources for their peers in order to make a positive impact on campus and in the community. Service Ambassadors meet weekly and serve year-long terms beginning in January and running through November.</p>
<hr />
<p><b><u><font size="5px">Impact</font></b></u></p>
ServeUGA is currently partnered with 40+ organizations and is constantly searching for new partnerships.
We organize volunteer days, advertise on campus and around Athens, as well as encourage students to get
involved in their community.

Hands On Athens, and several others.
